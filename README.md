## exibit

exibit solves the issue of artists not being able to earn from their creativity as much as they should, by allowing them to exhibit their talent and share their artwork by taking a picture of it and instantly publishing it on the internet as an NFT. Interested people can see it on their feed and buy it using eth and subsequent amount will get deposited into the ownerâ€™s account. All of these transactions will be recorded on the blockchain. Owners can decide the supply of the art and who they are selling it to.
