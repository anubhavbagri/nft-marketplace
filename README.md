## 🔍What it does
**exibit** solves the issue of artists not being able to earn from their creativity as much as they should, by allowing them to exhibit their talent and share their artwork by taking a picture of it and instantly publishing it on the internet as an NFT. Interested people can see it on their feed and buy it using eth and subsequent amount will get deposited into the owner’s account. All of these transactions will be recorded on the blockchain. Owners can decide the supply of the art and who they are selling it to.

## 💡Problem we are trying to solve
 We observed that artists belonging to underprivileged sections of the society get limited audience and time frames to sell their art, which in turn results in most of them getting underpaid by huge margins.

Hence, our mission would be to provide accessibility and knowledge of NFTs to local and in-house artists, especially those hailing from rural and economically backward areas, who are not exposed to the latest technologies but have creativity and artistic talents in them; They would thus have full ownership of their artwork by converting it to an NFT quickly without getting into the technicalities.

<!--- Even though nfts are of great value and solve a lot of issues revolving around copyright and ownership of art, a major portion of artists(including people from rural areas or just normal non-tech people who may or may not be technically advanced enough) still can't benefit from it due to the complex procedures which may seem overwhelming to them. -->

## 🤔 Who is impacted by the problem?
This problem currently affects a lot of digital/non-digital artists who do not have the technical knowledge behind NFTs. This includes local and in-house artists, especially those hailing from the rural and economically backward areas who have artistic talents in them.

## 😤 Why the problem matters!
The problem matters because it affects a major portion of the society who are technically backward and underprivileged who in-turn can benefit from the opportunities NFTs hold.

## 🧠 Solution
_exibit_ will use filecoin and polygon to quickly convert an image into an nft on-the-go and consequently, exhibit their artistic skills. Interested people can see it on their feed and buy it using eth and subsequent amount will get deposited into the owner’s account. All of these transactions will be recorded on the blockchain. Owners can decide the supply of the art and who they are selling it to. The first NFT would be, free to create, in order to facilitate onboarding of new artists.

## 🚀 How it works?

## 🏅 Why we chose Polygon?
- **Low cost of transactions:** Since putting an art as nft will require some eth to be deposited, it’s most viable to be kept at a minimum.
- **Quick transactions:** Since the process of selling and purchasing needs to be quick.
- **High throughput:** More sellers or customers require more TPS!
- **Ethereum Based:** Polygon has all the benefits from ethereum network, including the recent merge.
- **Security:** Inherently more secure.

## 💸 Business Model
- **First 3 NFTs will be generated for free**, to increase user adoption and increase engagement.
- Once an NFT is sold, a certain percentage of the price would be cut, to compensate for the gas fees of the FREE NFTs.
- After any of the first 3 NFTs’ is sold, the artist shall have to pay for gas fees for generating any new NFTs.
- The artist shall be able to promote their works by paying a minimal advertising fees to the platform and their work will be promoted as sponsored or advertised content.
