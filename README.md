## 🔍What it does
**exibit** solves the issue of artists not being able to earn from their creativity as much as they should, by allowing them to exhibit their talent and share their artwork by taking a picture of it and instantly publishing it on the internet as an NFT. Interested people can see it on their feed and buy it using eth and subsequent amount will get deposited into the owner’s account. All of these transactions will be recorded on the blockchain. Owners can decide the supply of the art and who they are selling it to.

## 💡Problem we are trying to solve
We observed that artists belonging to underprivileged sections of the society get limited audience and time frames to sell their art, which in turn results in most of them getting underpaid by huge margins.

Hence, our mission would be to provide accessibility and knowledge of NFTs to local and in-house artists, especially those hailing from rural and economically backward areas, who are not exposed to the latest technologies but have creativity and artistic talents in them; They would thus have full ownership of their artwork by converting it to an NFT quickly without getting into the technicalities.
